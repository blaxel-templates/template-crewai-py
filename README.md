## üöÄ Quick Start

For those who want to get up and running quickly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-crewai-py.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd template-crewai-py

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start the server
bl serve --hotreload

# In another terminal, test the agent crew
bl chat --local blaxel-agent
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.10 or later
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust
- **Blaxel Platform Setup:** Complete Blaxel setup by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started#quickstart)
  - **[Blaxel CLI](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started):** Ensure you have the Blaxel CLI installed. If not, install it globally:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
    ```
  - **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel platform
    ```bash
    bl login YOUR-WORKSPACE
    ```

## üíª Installation

**Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-crewai-py.git
cd template-crewai-py
uv sync
```

## üîß Usage

### Running the Server Locally

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
bl serve --hotreload
```

_Note:_ This command starts the server and enables hot reload so that changes to the source code are automatically reflected.

### Testing your agent

You can test your agent crew using the chat interface:

```bash
bl chat --local blaxel-agent
```

Or run it directly with specific input:

```bash
bl run agent blaxel-agent --local --data '{"input": "Research and write a comprehensive report on renewable energy trends"}'
```

### Deploying to Blaxel

When you are ready to deploy your application:

```bash
bl deploy
```

This command uses your code and the configuration files under the `.blaxel` directory to deploy your application.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blaxel Platform Issues**:
   - Ensure you're logged in to your workspace: `bl login MY-WORKSPACE`
   - Verify models are available: `bl get models`
   - Check that functions exist: `bl get functions`

2. **Agent Coordination Problems**:
   - Check crew configuration and agent role definitions
   - Verify task dependencies and execution order
   - Monitor agent communication logs

3. **Performance and Timeout Issues**:
   - Adjust max_iterations in crew configuration
   - Optimize task complexity and scope
   - Monitor resource usage during crew execution

4. **Tool Integration Failures**:
   - Verify tool permissions in Blaxel platform
   - Check tool compatibility with agent roles
   - Review tool execution logs for errors

5. **Memory and Context Management**:
   - Monitor crew memory usage with large tasks
   - Implement context summarization for long workflows
   - Optimize agent prompt engineering
